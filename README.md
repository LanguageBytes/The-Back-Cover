## User Story
```
AS A book enthusiast,
I WANT to be able to have a hub within which I can explore, discuss books and see what others are reading.

WHEN I click on the homepage,
THEN I am presented with an option to sign in or sign up and am presented with a list of top picks or authors.

WHEN I am signed in, 
THEN I am directed to a dashboard with my books and profile information.

WHEN I click on the browse page,
THEN I am presented with a list of books and an option to search for books I like.

WHEN I click on a book,
THEN  I am able to favourite it.

WHEN I click on the community page,
THEN  I am able to view the posts of other users.

```

- Proxy errors, npm errors and issues with node updates 

## Successes
