# The Back Cover

## Description

In this project we created a platform to use as a virtual back cover (hence the name); where the user can track the books they want to read and see what other people think about it. Our motivation to create this application is for people who suffer from short term memory and can never remember which books had taken their fancy. We decided to focus our application around books because of our shared love of reading. How instinctively the user can utilise our site is what will make it stand out.

## User Story
```
AS A book enthusiast,
I WANT to be able to have a hub within which I can explore, discuss books and see what others are reading.

WHEN I click on the homepage,
THEN I am presented with an option to sign in or sign up and am presented with a list of top picks or authors.

WHEN I am signed in, 
THEN I am directed to a dashboard with my books and profile information.

WHEN I click on the browse page,
THEN I am presented with a list of books and an option to search for books I like.

WHEN I click on a book,
THEN  I am able to favourite it.

WHEN I click on the community page,
THEN  I am able to view the posts of other users.

```
