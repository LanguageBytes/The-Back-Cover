# The Back Cover

## Description

In this project we created a platform to use as a virtual back cover (hence the name); where the user can track the books they want to read and see what other people think about it. Our motivation to create this application is for people who suffer from short term memory and can never remember which books had taken their fancy. We decided to focus our application around books because of our shared love of reading. How instinctively the user can utilise our site is what will make it stand out.

## User Story
```
AS A book enthusiast,
I WANT to be able to have a hub within which I can explore, discuss books and see what others are reading.

WHEN I click on the homepage,
THEN I am presented with an option to sign in or sign up and am presented with a list of top picks or authors.

WHEN I am signed in, 
THEN I am directed to a dashboard with my books and profile information.

WHEN I click on the browse page,
THEN I am presented with a list of books and an option to search for books I like.

WHEN I click on a book,
THEN  I am able to favourite it.

WHEN I click on the community page,
THEN  I am able to view the posts of other users.

## Challenges

- Our main struggle through this project was being able to retrieve a single book cover through the Google Books API. We fixed this by scrutinising every detail of our code and being determined to find the bug. 
- Another challenge we had was running into a lot of non descriptive errors such as Proxy errors, npm errors and issues with node updates. We overcame this by researching online ways to debug these errors until we found ones that worked.
- One more obstacle we faced was when working individually, we would have merging conflicts, we improved on this by communicating effectively to what we were currently working on.


## Successes

- Our teamwork was a great success as we met on a zoom call every day to get through all the challenges we were facing in the project. This meant we were able to tackle any problems we were having as a group. 
- Another success we had was the use of the chakra ui as originally intended on using Semantic UI but ran into a variety of bugs. We were worried about using another component library because of this . We however had a straightforward experience with this UI and easily made the application responsive.
- An additional success is that our application is interactive and straightforward to use, for example they can log in and sign up with there being many buttons that will lead them to these pages.
- The final success is that we were able to make a user-focused MERN app that can store the needed data.



## Future Developments

- The main future development we want to implement is being able to add an interactive section between our users. This would include them being able to see each other's favourite books and also the ability to post reviews on books; to give it more of a community feeling.
- An additional improvement we want to add to our site is being able to categorise the books that the user is looking through so that if they have a genre of particular interest they are able to explore more books in that area and thus the site is more catered towards them.
- Along with catering to our userâ€™s predefined interests we also want to give them inspiration on new books they should try,  we would do this through using a trusted website to show top pick books.
- The last development we want to build on is making our favourite books page more interactive by allowing the user to delete favourite books.
